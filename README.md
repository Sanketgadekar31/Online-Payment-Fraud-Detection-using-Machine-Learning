# Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains the work done during my AI internship at Infosys on detecting online payment fraud using machine learning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent online payment transactions. This involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation and application development.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for the project, including data processing scripts and machine learning models.
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models.
- `results/`: Output results, including evaluation metrics and visualizations.

### Prerequisites
